# FAQ
**It's asking me to install something called .NET Desktop Runtime?**

That's correct. It's needed to run the application. (It's not a virus. Promise.)

**I inverted sprint but I'm not sprinting?**

You probably still have sprint bound to 'w' and now that Invert Sprint is on, you're always holding the 'walk' button. Set sprint back to left shift.

**Can I submit a run to the SRC leaderboards with the speedometer enabled?**

No.

**I set my FPS to 240 but I'm only getting x?**

Your pc probably can't render more than x.

**My auto splitter isn't working?**

Make sure you are using the latest version of LiveSplit, have the auto splitter patch enabled and have deactivated the auto splitter option built into LiveSplit.

**Why does my auto splitter not split when I finish the level?**

You probably have it set to Split by World. Change the setting to Split by Level.

**My jump button doesn't work anymore!**

You've probably enabled the jumpless patch. Re-patch the game with it disabled.
